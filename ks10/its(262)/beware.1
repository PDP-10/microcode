DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Nearly all the RED PACK documentation has changed and we've added a few
new documents to help you along with this release. READ the documentation!!
The new documents are----
1. RED20.HLP            INTRODUCES YOU TO THE "RED PACK" AND SHOWS HOW TO
                        FORMAT,BUILD,AND CONFIGURE A RED PACK FROM BACK UP
                        TAPES. THIS DOCUMENT ALSO HAS EXAMPLES OF "MIC" FILES.
                        REFERENCE THIS DOCUMENT ON HOW TO RUN "MIC" FILES.
2. REDIAG.HLP           SHOWS EXAMPLES OF HOW TO RUN 2020 DIAGNOSTICS. INCLUDES
                        DN22 DIAGNOSTIC EXAMPLES.
3. REDCOM.MEM           THIS ONE GIVES YOU INFORMATION ON THE COMMUNICATION 
                        HARDWARE AND ALSO EXPLAINS HOW TO RUN DN22 ACCEPTANCE.
Some new releases of some old "friends" also are contained in this release.
Most of the changes were added to reflect TOPS20 RELEASE 4 and also changes
were made to reflect the new "UETP" version. These documents are------------
1. RED20.MEM            THIS REFERENCE MANUAL DESCRIBES THE RED PACK INTERNALS.
                        MUCH WORK WAS DONE TO SUPPORT THE NEW "MIC" FILES AND
                                                      Page 3
                        THE NEW VERSION OF UETP. THE "MIC" FILES TAKE THE
                        PLACE OF THE "NEWRUN" FILES ON RED 303!! THERE ARE MANY
                        NEW CONFIGURATION FILES, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY
                        LOOK OVER THIS DOCUMENT FOR THE CHANGES!!
2. REDUSR.MEM           INCLUDES NEW EXAMPLES OF UETP ACCEPTANCE. NOTICE THE
                        NEW UETP TESTS ADDED.
3. RED20.POL            TELLS YOU ABOUT RED PACK POLICIES AND HOW TO ORDER
                        THE RED TAPES 1,3. CHANGED TO REFLECT RED V.404
4. RED20.REV            SHOWS VERSIONS OF THE EXEC,MONITOR, AND DIAGNOSTICS.
                        CHANGED TO REFLECT RED V.404.
5. KSREF.MEM            ADDED BIT TABLES FOR THE CD11 AND DUP11. ALSO ADDED A
                        TRUTH TABLE FOR CSL EB COMMAND.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
UETP
----
Major changes were made to this program and new tests were added for SYSTEM
ACCEPTANCE. Most of the changes made to "UETP.EXE" were made to make it
compatible with TOPS20 RELEASE 4. You'll notice a big difference in the 
speed of the magtape I/O handling due to release 4 and the UETP magtape tests
can now be run with either a large reel of tape (2400 ft.) or a small reel
of tape (800 ft.). Also the KMC/DUP loopback tests REALLY WORK NOW!!
The new UETP TESTS are---------
1. DUPA                 KMC/DUP#0 LOOPBACK TEST
2. DUPB                 KMC/DUP#1 LOOPBACK TEST
3. DUPAB                KMC/DUP#0,1 LOOPBACK TESTS (RUN THIS IF YOU HAVE 2 DUPS)
4. TEST72               USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER LOOPBACK TESTS TO
                        LOOPBACK THE DATA!!
NOTE: THESE UETP TESTS REPLACE SNDER1 AND SRVER1 THAT WERE PRESENT ON RED V.303
---
5. LPT0                 PRINTS A "SY ALL" AND "MONITR.STS" AT THE COMPLETION
                        OF A PASS. THIS TEST REQUIRES THAT THE LINEPRINTER
                        REMAIN "ONLINE" DURING ACCEPTANCE. IF YOU DO GET ERRORS
                        RUNNING THIS TEST, GO BACK AND RUN DSLPA!!
6. DN22IN               THIS TEST IS FOR 2020 SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DN22 HARDWARE
                        AND MODEM ELIMINATORS. THIS TEST NEEDS DN22OU TO BE
                        RUNNING TO WORK CORRECTLY!!
7. DN22OU               THIS TEST IS ALSO FOR 2020 SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DN22
                                                      Page 4
                        HARDWARE AND MODEM ELIMINATORS. THIS TEST MUST BE
                        STARTED FOR DN22IN TO RUN!!
KNOWN BUGS IN UETP
------------------
Currently there are some known "flaws" with UETP. These problems were found
late in the testing and could not be corrected for this release. There are 2
known bugs in UETP. They are---------
1. ABORT ALL PROBLEM    THIS VERSION OF UETP REQUIRES THAT TWO ABORT ALL
                        COMMANDS HAVE TO BE GIVEN SOMETIMES. IF YOU DO A
                        ABORT ALL OR JUST AN ABORT XXX WHERE XXX IS THE
                        NAME OF THE TEST, DEPENDING ON WHICH STATE THE JOB
                        IS IN THAT YOUR ABORTING, THE TEST OR TESTS MIGHT
                        START BACK UP AFTER YOU HAVE ABORTED THEM. YOU CAN
                        SOLVE THIS BY ABORTING THE JOB AGAIN OR ABORTING
                        ALL OF THEM AGAIN.
2. DSRLST               WHENEVER THE UETP TESTS DUPA,DUPB,OR DUPAB ARE RUN
                        WITH TEST72 THIS "BUGINF" MIGHT OCCUR AT THE END OF THE
                        TEST. WITH THE TEST DUPAB, THIS "BUGINF" MIGHT OCCUR
                        TWICE PER PASS.
                        (DSRLST= DATA SET READY LOST)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM SOFTWARE
------ --------
1. NEW MONITOR AND EXEC , MONITOR-SUPPORT PROGRAMS
        Highest visible change: SPEED-improvement !!
        Nearly all Support programs are now running under SYSJOB .
        This includes:
        LPTSPL - the Lineprinter Spooler
        MOUNTR - the handler for TAPE and STRUCTURE mounting
        ORION - the message processor
        QUASAR- the spooling system manager
        INFO - the inter-job communication handler
        MAILER - Mail support
        MAPPER - speedup thru mapping of common programs
        FAL20 - Network File Access Support
        STATUS - accumulating DISK and Tape transfer statistics
        OPER20 - general cleanup and SYSERR-queing every day
        CDRIVE - Card Reader support
        SPRINT - Card  Batch handler
        *** Beware : This is the absolute maximum of load SYSJOB can handle
Communication and setup for all STRUCTURE , TAPE and QUEING is handled
by OPR , running under PTYCON. So if you want to use "OPR" all you have
to do is---------
1. LOGIN F-S
2. ENABLE
3. OPR
Now you'll see this output at the CTY.
OPR>
                                                      Page 5
If you would like to see a "STATUS" of the DISK-DRIVES do this
OPR>SHOW STATUS DISK-DRIVES
...and wait for the output!!
The possibilities are endless!!
If your lineprinter for some reason gets "HUNG" it's a good idea to try 
the following-----
1. LOG F-S
2. ENA
3. OPR
OPR>STOP PRINTER 0
OPR>START PRINTER 0
OPR>CONTINUE PRINTER 0
If that doesn't work you can always speak directly to SYSJOB by the
^eSPEAK command and talk to LPTSPL. If all else fails reload the system!!
With release of TOPS20 VERSION 4 it is possible to have TAPE LABELING.
The RED PACK does NOT have this function enabled. If you do happen
to come across a system with this feature, instead of using the ASS MTA0
command, use the "MOUNT TAPE" command. See example.
If you want to DUMP the <f-s> area of the disk to tape try this-----
1. LOAD A WRITE-ENABLED MAGTAPE ON A FREE TAPE DRIVE
2. ENTER THE FOLLOWING
   @MOUNT TAPE MT:/WRITE-ENABLED
AT THIS POINT YOU'LL HAVE TO ISSUE A CNTRL-C
   (YOUR REQUEST WILL REMAIN IN THE QUEUE)
3. @ENA
4. $OPR
5. OPR>IDENTIFY MTA0: REQUEST X
6. OPR>EXIT
7. $DUMPER
8. DUMPER>TA MT:
9. DUMPER>REWIND
10.DUMPER>SAVE PS:<F-S>*.*.*  PS:<F-S>*.*.*
11.DUMPER>EXIT
12.@DISMOUNT TAPE MT:
To really get familiar with OPR it is advised to do a type out of the
                                                      Page 6
OPR help file like this---
1. LOG F-S
2. ENA
3. TYPE PS:<SUBSYS>OPR.HLP
and wait for the output!!
KNOWN SYSTEM SOFTWARE BUGS
--------------------------
Currently there is one known MONITR BUG. The problem occurs when a 2020
system has 1 KMC AND 1 DUP.
The message
%NETCON COULD NOT OBTAIN TOPOLOGY MAP
will appear on the CTY at system start up!! 2020'S with 1 KMC AND 2 DUPS
do not exhibit the problem!!
There is also a problem in MOUNTR. If a disk-drive is online during system
start up time with bad HOME BLOCKS it might cause a different drive with
good HOME BLOCKS to have problems mounting. For example if you have created
USER AND USER1 and have another drive online that has not yet been created
into a structure(USING CHECKD), it might cause USER or USER1 to have problems
when trying to mount those structures!! The way to get around this
problem is to take the drive with the BAD HOMEBLOCKS offline, bring the
system down then back up. A patch will probably be provided for this problem
in the future!
PATCHES TO THE MONITOR
----------------------
PROBLEM: Errors on TU77 tape drives can cause TM2CCI and PH2RAE BUGCHKS
         and KEEP ALIVE errors.
THE "RED PACK" HAS BEEN PATCHED TO FIX THE PROBLEM!!
