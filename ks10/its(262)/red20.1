The following gives the first description on how to use RED , the pack used for checkout , diagnosis  and  reliability  runs  for  a
DEC2020 system.
The RED pack ( Reliability Exerciser and Diagnostics for DEC2020 ) contains the following areas:
        <SYSTEM>         .... normal + magtape boots and micro-code
        <OPERATOR>       .. normal
        <SUBSYS>         ..
        <UNSUPPORTED>    ..
        <F-S>            "WHEEL" and access to <UETP> work-area
        <DIAGNOSTICS>    FILES ONLY area holding Diagnostics
        <UETP>           working area for User Environmental Test Package
        <UETP.LIB>       file-area for UETP
        <UETP.xxx>       work area for program-runs under UETP
        <RED>            Documentation and utilities for RED
 Password for <F-S is F-S , the only other area with privileges is <OPERATOR , both  areas  passwords  should  be  changed  for  the
specific installation , preferably <F-S to CCxxx , where xxx is YOUR Cost Center number.

YOU might want to "save" YOURSELF the pain of doing it again , or of being
"done in" by some "superior force".
YOU need one scatch-tape (2400 feet ) ,  write-enabled on MTA0:, and about 15
minutes "spare" time.

Note:   When "*.*" is typed after DIAGNOSTIC-UPDATE all files that are
        on MTA0 will be put in the system. If you wish to update just one
        diagnostic just specify the full name of the diagnostic instead of
        *.* . For example if you wanted to take a new version of DSLPA off
        the tape and put it on the RED PACK enter DO DIAGNOSTIC-UPDATE DSLPA.SAV
        and wait till you see

        and YOU must update m-code for the SYSTEM , in case YOU got a new
        version of it on the tape !!!
2. DO PS-MICRO
Note:   In case YOU already did YOUR "FULL Backup" of RED , YOU have to

Type "Carriage return" to BOOT to get MONITOR
... answer start-up questions and wait till PTYCON comes back with
the final status-summary.
Log in under <F-S> by typing "LOG F-S F-S" ... this password will be
different after it has been changed!!
        If YOU just want to run some diagnostics in TS , type

                        0
        If YOU want also to run some "real" programs for checkout , do
the following:
        DO CLEAN.MIC ( to clean up the areas and start UETP) 
        ( some files cannot be deleted , they are the protected SUB-directories
        for UETP )
        Mount a magtape ( write-enabled ) on unit 0
        Reference RED20.HLP on how to configure a RED PACK              
        The CLEAN.MIC file automatically starts UETP by the RELIAB.CMD
        this will start the jobs for a runtime of a total of 48 hours!        
****************************************************************************
The current  KS checkout during F A & T runs for 48 hours ( no errors ) .
For "quick" checkout in the field a 24 hour run ( no errors ) is sufficient.
****************************************************************************
        If YOU want to see , where YOU are , type "STATUS"
        If YOU want to abort everything type "ABORT ALL"
                                             "EXIT"

                        document <RED>REDCOM.MEM for more infomation.
<UNSUPPORTED>KDPSTS     allows YOU to "peek" into the KMC/DUP status in case
                        YOU have the NETWORK-tests running.
<UNSUPPORTED>SPY allows YOU to watch TTY-I/O traffic of another job
                (YOU get out of it via Control/C and BREAK )
<UNSUPPORTED>STRTST is a facility for structure-testing , it handles
                MOUNTING , DISMOUNTING , CREATING and CHECKING of structures
<UNSUPPORTED>DIRTST is a facility to test the state of DIRECTORIES
<UNSUPPORTED>READ allows to "read" a file and check for hard/soft errors
<UNSUPPORTED>LPLOAD is a facility which allows to change VFU and RAM on the
                fly ( one has ofcourse to kick off LPTSPL before doing that)

        The F A and T process breaks logically today down into two phases:
                1.      Module integration and basic checkout
                2.      Reliablity run for the total SYSTEM
Phase 1         Module integration and basic checkout
        Depending on what Hardware is available , DIAGNOSTICS can be loaded either from magtape (slow) , or DIAGNOSTICS can be  used
        from RED ( floating RED in F A & T maybe ??  )
        After we have made sure , that all modules play together , we want to check Hardware Reliability of the total SYSTEM  .   It
        is  advsiable to use at this time SOFTWARE , which has already been proven to be solid , and which needs a minimum amount of
        changes ( reconfiguration etc .  ) to work on any SYSTEM.
        ...  We enter phase 2 ...
Phase 2         Reliability run for the total SYSTEM
        The supplied RED-Backup tape(s) are used to build a RED-pack .
        ( time-requirement roughly 45 minutes --- Reference <REDRED20.HLP)
        The control-files are modified to take into account Hardware differences.

        If the system contains more than one disk-unit , the following
steps have to be taken
        1. Run CHECKD to include the "other" packs in one of the structures
           USER or USER1
        2. Type "SMOU USER:" and/or "SMOU USER1:" to get structure(s) mounted.
        3. Type "DO USER" and/or "DO USER1" to create the necessary
           directories for structures USER and/or USER1
        Example: ( PS: on 0,0 ; "user:" to be on 0,1 ;"user1:" to be on 0,2 )

The following is a short description and guide for running the UETP ,
which will be used for testing the KS20 in MONITOR-mode and will be
used during F A & T - time during the reliability run hours. For a
more detailed procedure for running UETP reference RED20.USR.
What is UETP ?
______________
UETP is a package of programs , which allows YOU to run programs via
BATCH-files . UETP also gives YOU easy control for submitting these 
files and allows YOU to query the state of the submitted jobs.
UETP only needs IPCF-privileges to run.
Where are my "UETP-files"?
__________________________
Assuming that YOU are using the KS20 diagnostic pack RED , and are
running the MONITOR ... and are logged in as <F-S> , all the needed
files are in <UETP.LIB> , a subdirectory of <UETP> -- the working
directory for UETP-usage.
All files are "visible" to you , so YOU can type them out , or can do
a "DIRECTORY"-command to see whats in there.
How do I run UETP ?
___________________
******************************************************************
For checking-reasons it is recommended YOU do the above operations
on a hard-copy device ( at least the first time )
******************************************************************
Assuming the above ( RED in use , logged in as <F-S> ) YOU do the
following:
TYPE-IN                         RESULTS
_______                         _______
DO CLEAN.MIC            This cleans up work areas, connects to <uetp>,
                        and starts UETP via the RELIAB.CMD
.......and watch the output ....
***** see example at the end *****
What-can-I-do-to-query-UETP?                                                                                               Page 10-5î____________________________
UETP is a native DEC20 program , so if YOU don't know anything
YOU can type a "?" to it , if YOU need help at a specific stage inside
a command , typing "?" will give you help there , if YOU want overall
help , YOU can type "HELP" to UETP.
Basically two forms of operation are supported:
For the general case , it is recommended to use the supplied *.VER
files .
These files can be started with the "TAKE" command by just doing a
"TAKE RELIAB" ... and UETP will know what to do.
 If YOU want to do something special , YOU need to know more.
All programs run , have BATCH-command files , which have one of
three extensions:
NAME.ext --- where NAME is test name and ext can be VER for verification
                                                
                                                CMP for comprehensive
                                                APP for application
( currently only VER files developed and tested )
To enable a specific test FOO , YOU type to UETP "ENAble FOO"
To begin this test FOO  , YOU type to UETP "BEGin FOO"
To stop test FOO  , YOU type to UETP "ABOrt FOO"
To disable test FOO from the "RUN-table" , YOU type "DISable FOO"
The keyword "ALL" will do it for all "known" tests for the "RUN-table"
                        ******WARNING******
CURRENT VERSION OF UETP MIGHT REQUIRE TWO "ABORT ALL" COMMANDS TO
ABORT ALL OF THE UETP TESTS RUNNING!!!
What-to-look-for-during-UETP-runs?                                                                                         Page 10-6î__________________________________
The "STatus"-command of UETP gives YOU a fast overview , what's going on.  A "clean" run will have "0" in the  "ERROR"-column.   The
BATCH-jobs  try  to  be helpful in giving YOU text-output in case of errors.  UETP will have the same ERROR-output in EXCEPT.LOG and
also will leave the results in file(s) which have the following naming-convention:  Example:  test Mta0 develops an error ,  so  the
resulting BATCH LOG-FILE "MTA0.LOG" is renamed to "MTA0.ERL" ,when the job is completed ( "END" message seen ) So if YOU finally ran
out of patience , or accumulated enough errors, You do the following:
UETP> ST
UETP> ABO ALL
UETP> EXIT
@PRI *.ERL     (Enter "TYPE *.ERL" if no lineprinter available)
which prints the LOG-files which had errors and brings YOU back to YOUR original  area  .   After  analysing  the  BATCH-output  and
correcting the problems , YOU start from above !
@CONN
@DO CLEAN.MIC
Note:   If the system should crash during an UETP-run , all jobs , which have already been submitted , but not run  yet  ,  will  be
        started the next time , YOU bring the monitor up .  In this case it is very advisable to log-in , enable yourself and do an
        Cancel Batch */user:f-s
        which will kill the "wild"-running jobs.  The "CLEAN-Command" will do the same thing , just to make sure.

UETP has built-in Control-C Intercept to safeguard You as much as possible against DISASTERS ( Don't forget ,  the  "simplicity"  of
UETP is achieved by running a background-job which handles the IPCF-message traffic )
On a single TTY-system however , YOU can "leave" UETP by doing a "PUSH" which will supply YOU with  an  "inferior  Fork"  underneath
UETP , so that YOU can do at YOUr leisure "TYPE *.ERL" , "Inf Ba" , "SY ALL F-S" and other good things.
Don't forget to go back to UETP by un-doing the previous "PUSH" with a "POP"-command ,which brings YOU back to UETP.

UETP>HELP
SET-UP COMMANDS
        These commands cause the UETP command processor to  perform  the
        desiganted  function immediately.  They are more closely related
        to the preparation of an UETP run than to the run itself.
                1.      TAKE (COMMANDS FROM) <filespec>
        
                   The contents of <filespec> will be taken as  commands
                   until  end of file is encountered.  After end-of-file
                   Command Processor will revert to the TTY.
        
                        BEGIN (UETP RUN AFTER) <hh:mm>
        
                   The batch jobs  will  be  submitted  after  the  time
How-can-I-run-UETP-on-a-single-TTY ( no LPT ) System?                                                                     Page 10-11î__________________________________
                   specified  by  the  <hh:mm> argument.  If the <hh:mm>
                   argument is missing, the job will be submitted to  be
                   run immediately.
PARAMETER SETTING COMMANDS
        
                Each command  sets  parameters  which  define  the  test
                environment.   A  command may be superceded by giving it
                again, with different  arguments.   All  parameters  are
                initialized  to  default settings which are indicated in
                the appropriate paragraphs below.  However, once a value
                has  been  specified it becomes the default until it has
                been respecified.
        
        
        1.      ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS
        
                This command determines which UETP tests should be  run,
                and for each test, what level of testing should be done.
                This command does not actualy start the test.   It  only
                flags  the  features  which  will  be run when the BEGIN
                command is typed.

                The basic idea is to allow  the  user  to  detemine  the
                complexity  (DEPTH)  of  the  procedure and the duration
                (CYCLE).
                        <test>, is the file name of a batch control file
                        in UETP directory with file types of .VER, .CMP
                        and/or .APP
                        In this manner a user can increase the number of
                        procedures available by merely adding files to
                        the directory.  For example, the COBOL batch
                        control files might be called:
                                
                                COBOL.VER
                                COBOL.CMP
                                COBOL.APP
        
How-can-I-run-UETP-on-a-single-TTY ( no LPT ) System?                                                                     Page 10-12î__________________________________
                        If an additional COBOL test was desired (COBOL2)
                        we  would  create  the  following  batch control
                        files:
        
                                COBOL2.VER
                                COBOL2.CMP
                                COBOL2.APP
                
        
                b.      The argument "ALL" will cause all the  tests  of
                        the currently specified or defaulted DEPTH value
                        to be enabled.  
                e.      DEFAULT CONDITIONS  -  The  default  values  for
                        "DEPTH" and "CYCLE" are initialy VERIFICATION and
                        1 respectively.  Once sepcified  the  new  value
                        becomes   the  default  until  a  new  value  is
                        specified.  In the following example  the  depth
                        value is the same in both commands:
                        
                        ENABLE APL/DEPTH:COMPREHENSIVE
                        ENABLE DISK
        
                f.      The switch "DEPTH" allows the user to select one
                        of three levels of testing within each category.
                        The net result here is that  one  of  the  three
                        file    types    get   selected   (.VER,
                        .CMP or .APP)
        
                g.      The switch "CYCLE" determines how many times the
                        specified  product  should be run.  It overrides
                        any   previous   specification   of   for   this
                        procedure.  A value of zero (0) disables a test.
                        n - Specifies number of times this test be  run.
                              A zero value disables the test.
        
                        CONTINUOUS - Specifies that this function should
                              run continuously.
        
                        hh:mm - Specifies the  elapsed  wall  clock  end
                              time   from   start  to  finish  for  this
                              procedure.
        
        
        2.  DEFAULT
        
        
                The DEFAULT command changes the default values  for  the
                /CYCLE  and  /DEPTH  switches.   The  setting of the new
                defaults effects all UETP commands.  The format is:

                where, <test> is  the  file  name  of  the  verification
                procedure (see ENABLE command).
        4.  PUSH
                The PUSH command places the  user  in  EXEC  mode  while
                continuing  to run the UETP.  The user can type commands
                or run programs.  He will not be able to  log  out.   To
                return to the UETP enviornment the user will use the POP
                command.  Messges normally appearing on the console from
                the UETP will be supressed.
        5.  WAIT
                The WAIT command  causes  the  UETP  to  sleep  for  the
                specified time.  This command was installed to allow the
                UETP to run under batch.  Normally, when the  UETP  runs
                it  always  wants  input from the TTY.  Under batch, the
                UETP gets aborted because there is no more input for it.
                The  WAIT  command  keeps  it from telling batch that it
                wants  the  next  command  and  therefore  avoids  being
                aborted.   The  second field is an extra wizzy that will
                print the output of a STATUS command  at  the  specified
                interval.   Note that the STATUS output interval must be
                less than the WAIT interval.  The command format is:
        
                WAIT (FOR) HHH:MM (with status every) HHH:MM
                WAIT (FOR) ALL (tests to complete with status every) HHH:MM
        6.  EXIT
        
                The EXIT command exits to monitor level.
        
        7.  HELP
        
               The HELP command prints out a help text  explaining  the
                commands.
