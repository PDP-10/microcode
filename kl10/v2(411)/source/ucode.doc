1.0  SUMMARY


     1.  Microcode version 2(411) is the twelfth release of  the  KL10
         microcode.

         This is the  seventh  release  of  the  KL10  microcode  that
         supports   an  'Extended  KL10'  described  in  the  Hardware
         Reference Manual.  Only KLX.RAM supports the 'Extended KL10'.
         (KLX.MCB  is  derived  from  KLX.RAM  and  does  support  the
         'Extended KL10'.)

         The KL10 microcode  is  different  for  TOPS-10  and  TOPS-20
         systems.   The  KL10  microcode  is different for model A and
         model B  processors.   (What  engineering  calls  a  model  B
         processor  is  sometimes  known  as  a  KL10-PV.) The TOPS-10
         microcode for model A processors is called U.RAM, for model B
         processors  it  is UB.RAM.  The TOPS-20 microcode for model A
         processors is called KLL.RAM, for model B  processors  it  is
         called  KLX.RAM.   The  PDP-11  front  end requires different
         formats of the microcode files.  These translated files  have
         different names.  TOPS-10 model A:  UA.MCB.  TOPS-10 model B:
         UB.MCB.   TOPS-20  model  A:   KLA.MCB.   TOPS-20  model   B:
         KLX.MCB.

     2.  The KL10 microcode is  not  dependent  on  any  monitor,  but
         because  of  hardware  differences  between  the  various -10
         processors, a monitor must  be  built  specifically  for  the
         KL10.  KL10 microcode version 2(411) has been tested with the
         TOPS-10 7.03 monitor.

See LCREV for information regarding microcode requirements for various
hardware revision levels.



2.0  KNOWN DEFICIENCIES

At present there are no known deficiencies in microcode 2(411).

3.0  FIXED PROBLEMS

The following problems have been fixed:

411  24 July 85--Another try at the SMP fix.  PI cycle 7 must go to
     memory for interlock to work, so delete use of the cache on the
     PHYS REF.  This may have performance drawbacks for TOPS-20 and
     TOPS-10 uniprocessor, so there may have to be two versions of
     microcode (again!) to resolve this.
410  11 July 85--Force PI functions 3 and 7 to use RPW cycles, so
     SMP will work properly.  Save a couple words in the process.
407  18 June 85--Change macro ARX_2 to ARX_2+MQ0 and fix related bug
     in ADJBP by clearing MQ on entry to instruction.  This prevents
     ADJBP from computing the wrong byte capacities for OWGs with
     byte sizes of 6 and 18.  Also reverse AC1 and AC2 in DB2WD.
     That was causing CVTDBx to reverse the byte pointer halves if
     an OWG was used, ruining things entirely.
406  11 Mar 85--Define R17 as HARDPFW, and save the hard page fail word
     there for TOPS-10, thus protecting it from getting clobbered by a
     later soft page fail.
400  9 Aug 84--Initial first edit number for releasable version 2.0.



4.0  RELATED DOCUMENTATION


The microcode is implicitly documented in the System Reference Manual,
in  that  it  is  an  implementation  of  a  PDP-10.   The  only other
documentation is in the listing and prints of the KL10 processor.






5.0  FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENT MICROCODE VERSIONS.


U.RAM is the microprogram which directs  the  operation  of  the  KL10
model  A  hardware  to  emulate the behavior of a PDP-10 for a TOPS-10
system.  UB.RAM is the microprogram which directs the operation of the
KL10  model  B  hardware (KL10-PV) to emulate the behavior of a PDP-10
for a TOPS-10 system.  UB.RAM should look exactly like U.RAM to PDP-10
software.



KLL.RAM is the microprogram which directs the operation  of  the  KL10
model  A  hardware  to  emulate the behavior of a PDP-10 for a TOPS-20
system.  KLX.RAM is the microprogram which directs  the  operation  of
the  KL10  model  B hardware to emulate the behavior of a PDP-10 for a
TOPS-20 system.  KLX.RAM implements the 'Extended KL10'  explained  in
the Hardware Reference Manual.
