1.0  SUMMARY


     1.  Microcode version 336 is the eleventh  release  of  the  KL10
         microcode.  Microcode version 336 appears as UB.MCB only.  It
         supports a model B KL10 for TOPS-10 V7.02.

         This is the sixth release of the KL10 microcode that supports
         an  'Extended  KL10'  described  in  the  Hardware  Reference
         Manual.  Only KLX.RAM supports the 'Extended KL10'.  (KLX.MCB
         is  derived  from  KLX.RAM  and  does  support  the 'Extended
         KL10'.)

         The KL10 microcode  is  different  for  TOPS-10  and  TOPS-20
         systems.   The  KL10  microcode  is different for model A and
         model B  processors.   (What  engineering  calls  a  model  B
         processor  is  sometimes  known  as  a  KL10-PV.) The TOPS-10
         microcode for model A processors is called U.RAM, for model B
         processors  it  is UB.RAM.  The TOPS-20 microcode for model A
         processors is called KLL.RAM, for model B  processors  it  is
         called  KLX.RAM.   The  PDP-11  front  end requires different
         formats of the microcode files.  These translated files  have
         different names.  TOPS-10 model A:  UA.MCB.  TOPS-10 model B:
         UB.MCB.   TOPS-20  model  A:   KLA.MCB.   TOPS-20  model   B:
         KLX.MCB.

     2.  The KL10 microcode is  not  dependent  on  any  monitor,  but
         because  of  hardware  differences  between  the  various -10
         processors, a monitor must  be  built  specifically  for  the
         KL10.   KL10  microcode  version 336 has been tested with the
         TOPS-10 release 7.02 monitor.

See LCREV for information regarding microcode requirements for various
hardware revision levels.



2.0  KNOWN DEFICIENCIES


     When executing a CVTBDO using a One Word Global Byte Pointer  the
fill is taken from E0 rather than E0+1.

3.0  FIXED PROBLEMS

The following problems have been fixed:

336  Back off 330 for a bit, since TOPS-10 7.02 must be tested and
     OWGs in section 0 fail for string instructions (they get converted
     to TWGs, which are illegal in section 0).  For now, we will maintain
     both sources.
335  Force memory to be released for SMP case of DPB if P > 36 causes no
     actual data to be stored.  Make an OWG reference to an address >
     37,,777777 cause a page fail (GBYTE was stripping the excess bits).
334  Fix conflict generated in CLRPT by 333 by creating new subroutine
     ARSWAP which is just AR_AR SWAP.  Make several other routines call it,
     thus saving a few words.
333  Add new conditional BIG.PT.  Under it, add code to implement the "Keep
     me" bit for paging as bit 5 of the page table, and to move it to page
     map bit 23 during page refill.  Also make DATAO PAG not clear Kept
     pages if bit 3 of the word is off.
332  Redefine all bank 7 ACs as R0,...,R17, and all bank 6 ACs as P0,...,
     P17.  Change all other alias definitions to refer to these.  This
     gives us a uniform cross reference for all scratch register references.
     Put all macro definitions into alphabetical order, making it easier
     to look up a macro definition.  Split the edit history into its own
     file.  There are no functional changes from 331.
331  Allow XSFM anywhere.  Clean up the code a bit in the process.  There
     still remain a number of references to XSFM or XPCW distinctions,
     and these could almost certainly be cleaned up further.
330  Allow one word global byte pointers in section zero.  This includes
     changes in BYTE, EIS, and FP.  Change GBYTE and CNV2WD to return 2;
     eliminate GTST as obsolete.  Also shuffle the calls to these routines
     to conform to the new calling conventions, and put the OWG test at
     the beginning of IBP, ILDB, IDBP, LDB, DPB, and ADJBP.
327  Add PAGCNT conditional.  Under it, include control to count entry
     into PFH code and DATAO PAG with bit 2 set.



4.0  RELATED DOCUMENTATION


The microcode is implicitly documented in the System Reference Manual,
in  that  it  is  an  implementation  of  a  PDP-10.   The  only other
documentation is in the listing and prints of the KL10 processor.






5.0  FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENT MICROCODE VERSIONS.


U.RAM is the microprogram which directs  the  operation  of  the  KL10
model  A  hardware  to  emulate the behavior of a PDP-10 for a TOPS-10
system.  UB.RAM is the microprogram which directs the operation of the
KL MICROCODE RELEASE DOCUMENT -- V336                           Page 4


KL10  model  B  hardware (KL10-PV) to emulate the behavior of a PDP-10
for a TOPS-10 system.  UB.RAM should look exactly like U.RAM to PDP-10
software.



KLL.RAM is the microprogram which directs the operation  of  the  KL10
model  A  hardware  to  emulate the behavior of a PDP-10 for a TOPS-20
system.  KLX.RAM is the microprogram which directs  the  operation  of
the  KL10  model  B hardware to emulate the behavior of a PDP-10 for a
TOPS-20 system.  KLX.RAM implements the 'Extended KL10'  explained  in
the Hardware Reference Manual.
